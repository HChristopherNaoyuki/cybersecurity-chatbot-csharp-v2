## Project Overview

This repository contains Version 2 of a cybersecurity-focused chatbot application written in C#. It is a direct evolution of the original [Cybersecurity Chatbot (C#)](https://github.com/HChristopherNaoyuki/cybersecurity-chatbot-csharp) project, maintaining the same MIT License.

**Current Status:** This version is currently in active development with several known issues (documented below). The primary goals for this iteration include:
- Resolving existing logic and GUI problems
- Improving overall code quality
- Enhancing cybersecurity capabilities
- Maintaining thorough documentation

## Key Features

### Core Functionality
- Interactive chatbot interface with cybersecurity focus
- Basic threat detection algorithms
- Security advice generation
- User education components

### Technical Components
- Windows Forms GUI implementation
- Natural language processing for basic queries
- Security knowledge database
- Conversation logging

## Known Issues

### Logic Problems
- Inconsistent threat detection responses
- Memory leaks in conversation handling
- Edge cases in input validation
- Inefficient query processing

### GUI Issues
- Layout problems on high-DPI displays
- Unresponsive UI elements during processing
- Inconsistent styling across forms
- Poor error message presentation

## Development Roadmap

### Short-term Goals
- [ ] Fix critical logic errors
- [ ] Resolve major GUI rendering issues
- [ ] Improve exception handling
- [ ] Update dependencies

### Long-term Goals
- [ ] Implement enhanced security features
- [ ] Add plugin architecture
- [ ] Develop testing framework
- [ ] Create documentation system

## Getting Started

   ```
2. Open the solution in Visual Studio
3. Restore NuGet packages
4. Build the solution (Ctrl+Shift+B)
5. Run the application (F5)

## Code Style Guidelines

### General Principles
- Strict Allman style brace formatting
- Meaningful, descriptive naming conventions
- SOLID principles where applicable
- Thorough XML documentation

### Specific Requirements
```csharp
// Good example
public class SecurityAnalyzer
{
    /// <summary>
    /// Analyzes input for potential security threats
    /// </summary>
    /// <param name="userInput">String to analyze</param>
    /// <returns>Threat level enumeration</returns>
    public ThreatLevel AnalyzeInput(string userInput)
    {
        if (string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(userInput))
        {
            throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(userInput));
        }
        
        // Implementation...
    }
}
```
